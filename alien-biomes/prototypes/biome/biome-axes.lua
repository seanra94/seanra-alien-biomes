-- distribution axes control biome type placement
--            volcanic
-- sand    |    dirt    |    grass
--             frozen
-- other axes used for biome subtypes (mineral/vegetation colors)
-- since new dimensions can't be created and noise layers are not sufficient
--    sub-sections of the distribution axes need to be used for subtypes
-- subtype variations (alternate textures) controlled maily by noise layers
