Vanilla Tree Notes:
01: Hydra: red tint, curly roots, branches early, spikey branches, sparese thick leaves, desert / dirt
02: Ash: grey trunk, thin leaves, tall tree, light connifer look, good for cold climate
03: Oak: desaturated yellow trunk, slightly twisted, normal looking, stubby roots, good for normal climate
04: Antler: red tinge, thick conical trunk, horizontal branching, good for drier climates.
05: Zigzag: grey zigzaging twisted trunk. horizontal scragely branches. thick leaves. good for blue areas
06: Willow: orange weeping tree, thick trunk but narrow overall. sparse leaves make it best for dirt / desert but would be good for wetland if thicker leaves
07: Weeper: grey thin conical trunk. weeping branches, lower branches root down. Good for mangrove style (turqoise) or pink flowers elsewhere
08: Crowsnest: red-grey thick conical trunk. branches all clustered at the top and then feather. good for hot dry climates
09: Baobob: yellow-grey very thick conical trunk. branches near the top are thick and spikey
dead-dry-hairy-tree: red tint, twisted trunk, horizontal, feahtery limbs
dead-grey-trunk: desaturated yellow, slightly twisted trunk, stubby limbs, horizontal and vertical
dead-tree-desert: red tinge, angular reachign branches, slender trunk, vertical
dry-hairy-tree: brown, weeping feathery limbs, slightly twisted trunk, branches early, vertical
dry-tree: a brown stump, few stubby branches, vertical
green-coral: stubby green coral.

Tree implementation:
each tree needs a "-stump" of type corpse
typrically the first tree is called "tree-##"
  but the subsequent trees are given an identifier "tree-##-red"
The vanilla trees are:
( temp_opt, temp_range, water_optimal, water_range, static_influence, tree_noise_influence )
  tree_autoplace(30, 5, 0.75, 0.25),
tree-01, 25~35, 0.5~1, olive green, yellow - desert edges
tree-02, 10~24, 0.55~0.75, lightish green - near desert edges
tree-02-red, 10~24, 0.4~0.5, -0.25 rare, yellow, red, green, multicolored pastel trees, small clumps in the desert
tree-03, 20~30, 0.7~0.9, light green, brown, yellow, red
tree-04, 5~19, 0.4~0.8, -0.5 rare, dark bluish green, likes mud and grass
tree-05, 5~19, 0.6~1, bright green, likes moisture
tree-06, 9~35, 0.05~0.15, brown/green, sparse
tree-06-brown, 9~35, 0.05~0.15, brownish-orange-light, sparse
tree-07, 15~35, 0.15~0.25, yellow/brownish-almost-green, sparse
tree-08, 15~25, 0.0~0.2, -1 rare, green-yellow, orange-brown, reddish, - for desert
tree-08-brown, 15~25, 0.0~0.2, -0.99 rare, - orange / brownish-light - for desert
tree-08-red, -10~0, 0.0~0.1, -5 rare, - reddish - for desert
tree-09-brown, 15~35, 0.15~0.25, -0.5 rare, greenish / brownish/ reddish -light- for desert
tree-09, 25~35, 0.4~0.5, -0.21 rare, dark green
tree-09-red, 5~25, 0.15~0.25, -0.5 rare, red - for green-grass

Wet Trees (01, 06, 07)
Temperate Trees (02, 03, 04, 05)
Dirt Trees (02, 03, 04, 05)
Desert trees (0.8 and 0.9, maybe 04)

Tree plans:
Temperature and aux control color. Extreme aux values can also push trees to only certain areas
Moisture controls type
Elevation could also be used in some cases (palm trees)
Moisture blocks:
Desert 0~0.4, Dirt 0.4~0.6, Dirt/Grass border 0.6~0.8, Deep grass, 0.8~1
above values may need to change so use table for M1, M2, M3, M4

By Biome (there will be some overlap)

Green:
  Light desaturated green
  bright green (low aux)
  Dark green

Olive:
  Dark green
  Orange and brown

Yellow:
  Orange
  Bright Green (low aux)
  Greeny Brown

Desert trees
Pink desert trees
Red desert trees
orange desert trees
Yellow desert trees
brown desert trees
green desert trees
dark green desert trees
Dark red desert trees
dark purple desert trees

dark green near-snow snow trees
dark turqoise near-snow snow trees
white snow trees

palm trees (use base 7 or 8 for now)

Color options:
Pick 2-X color options
take the first (primary) option and make a slightly darker duplicate
for each color, step 2/3 to each other color
exclude duplicates
repeat until 32 colors are there
